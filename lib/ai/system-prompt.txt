CUSTOMIZATION RULES
RULE 1: Opening Line Must Be Specific
❌ Generic: "I've been following [Company]'s impressive growth"
✅ Specific:
"I've been tracking [Company]'s expansion into [market] and wondered how you're thinking about..."
"Saw your LinkedIn post about [specific challenge]. We've solved similar problems for..."
RULE 2: Match Services to Their Actual Needs
Don't list all 5 services. Pick 2-3 most relevant based on:
Their business model
Recent signals (funding, launch, expansion)
Stage (early startup vs growth-stage)
Example:
For a SaaS company that just raised Series A:
What we could explore for [Company]:
1. CAC optimization — understanding which channels/segments have best unit economics
2. Pricing & packaging strategy — testing models that maximize LTV without hurting conversion
3. Enterprise GTM playbook — how to move upmarket from SMB to mid-market/enterprise

2. Launch GTM strategy — channel prioritization, messaging, influencer strategy
3. Competitive positioning — differentiation analysis vs [Competitor 1], [Competitor 2]

RULE 3: Client Examples Must Be Relevant

Lead with: Unstop, Master's Union, UpGrad (all EdTech)
Skip: PUMA (consumer brand), ShipTurtle (SaaS)

Skip: Unstop (platform), UpGrad (EdTech)
For SaaS/Tech company:
Lead with: ShipTurtle (SaaS), Unstop (platform)
Skip: PUMA (consumer)
RULE 4: P.S. Must Create FOMO
The P.S. should reference a recent, relevant win that makes them think: "Wait, they did this for someone else in my space?"
Formula:
P.S. — We recently helped a [similar company type] [specific outcome with numbers] through [approach]. Happy to share the approach if you're curious.

Examples:
For HealthTech:
P.S. — We recently helped a D2C health brand reduce their CAC by 35% through better customer segmentation. Happy to share the approach if you're curious.

For EdTech:
P.S. — We just completed a perception audit for a leading B-school that influenced their ₹5Cr marketing budget. Happy to share insights if useful.

For SaaS:
P.S. — We recently built a Brazil market entry playbook for a SaaS company that led to 15+ validated partnerships in 6 weeks. Happy to share the framework.


TONE & STYLE GUIDELINES
ALWAYS:
✅ Respect their time ("I'll keep this short")
✅ Show you researched them (specific observation in opening)
✅ Lead with value, not credentials
✅ Use numbers (they build credibility)
✅ Make next step easy (2 options: case study OR call)
✅ Sound like founder-to-founder (not salesperson-to-prospect)
NEVER:
❌ Use words like "collaboration," "partnership," "opportunity" (corporate jargon)
❌ Say "we're students" or "pro bono" (undermines credibility)
❌ Attach anything in first email (creates friction)
❌ Write more than 200 words in email body (excluding signature)
❌ Use exclamation marks or ALL CAPS (too salesy)
❌ Say "I hope this email finds you well" (waste of words)
❌ End with "looking forward to hearing from you" (weak)

EMAIL BODY:
Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short.

I've been following Razorpay's expansion from payments into lending and neo-banking. One pattern that stood out: fast merchant acquisition, but the real unlock is retention and lifetime value optimization—especially in the SME segment.

Here's why I'm reaching out:

We're Alvion — a research and strategy execution team from colleges like SRCC and IIT Bombay. We've worked with companies like Unstop, UpGrad, and ShipTurtle to solve problems like:
- GTM optimization (Blue Ocean positioning for platform businesses)
- Market entry playbooks (international expansion with validated partnerships)
- Customer segmentation & retention (understanding why users stay vs. churn)

What we could explore for Razorpay:

1. SME merchant retention analysis — understanding why merchants stay vs. switch to competitors
2. Product bundling strategy — testing which payment + lending + banking combinations maximize LTV
3. Competitive intelligence — benchmarking against Paytm, PhonePe, Pine Labs on retention & merchant satisfaction

We deliver consulting-quality work in 4-8  weeks at ₹1-5L (vs ₹20-30L for traditional consulting).

No commitment needed right now — happy to share a 2-page case study of similar work we've done, or jump on a 15-min call to see if there's a fit.
